# Readme Milestone1

## sources:
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/
  - here I found the basic code for my navbar 
    which I edited to put the nav-brand on the left and align the rest of the links on the right

### Problems  
* can't get the menu to expand and show items inside
  - solution:

* activate link in navbar when you reach that point through scrolling
