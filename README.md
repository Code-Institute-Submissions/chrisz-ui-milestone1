# Readme Milestone1

## sources:
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/navbar/
  - here I found the basic code for my navbar 
    which I edited to put the nav-brand on the left and align the rest of the links on the right
* https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/components/carousel/
  - used the carousel code from bootstrap and edited it to make it look nicer

### Problems  
* can't get the menu to expand and show items inside
  - solution: hadn't yet included the javascript plugin, now I have and the menu works

* activate link in navbar when you reach that point through scrolling (make it bigger)

* change carousel slide indicator into circles
